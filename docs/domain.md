Yes. You choose your own Domain name for your online store and sell products in your own brand name. This feature is not available in FREE plan.

## Will I be given a dedicated IP?
No, there is no dedicated IP. We would give you hosting on AWS. Scalability would be taken care of by us, you can leave all the technical complexities to us and concentrate on growing your business.

## How do we link a domain to my CommerceUp store?
You can either choose to do domain linking yourself or you can call our support and one of our support team members can assist you with the same.

## How do you distribute Apps?
CommerceUp hosts your app on own developer account if you currently do not have developer account. If you subscribe to premium plan, you can distribute your apps via your own account. For this you will have to pay developer fees for each platform separately.
